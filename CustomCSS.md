#How to replace the old Custom CSS

The reason Minimalist for Everything exists is because the old Custom CSS field was not enough. I created all of the modules completely within the extension.

  1. Target the site
    * Go to the site you want to customize, click the Minimalist icon and click "New Mod". This will create a new module that targets the domain.
    * OR from the dashboard click "New Module" and enter the URL you want to target in the "Includes field" (e.g. google.com/reader, mail.google.com)
  1. Enter the CSS:
    * One empty option will be created for you. Click "New Option" to edit it.
    * Enter your CSS and JS in the syntax highlighted fields.
    * You can add color-pickers and edit additional advanced settings by clicking "Advanced".
  1. If you would like to create more options (so you can easily toggle effects on and off) just click "Add option".
