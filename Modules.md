#Documentation of modules.

# What is it? #

A module is a collection of code that you can plug-in to Minimalist for Everything to achieve certain things. For example the Gmail module allows Minimalist for Everything to do all the same things Minimalist for Gmail could do.

Without modules, Minimalist for Everything wouldn't be much use for the average user.
